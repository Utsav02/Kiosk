# Kiosk
Kiosk for Ordering Food is a project that provides a system that processes the management of billing and data handling in a restaurant for full-fledged and efficient working. It helps the consumer to directly order the food, view the menu, and register themselves as a member of the restaurant.	

It also provides the manager of the restaurant who will have all the responsibilities to insert new items to the menu. This is safeguarded by an encryption which will prevent anyone from accessing the portal. The system is capable of creating proper bills for the customers, keeping a record of them in an appropriate manner and displaying menu. There are features such specific bill number and varied items and categories.

The back end of project is MySQL database where all information related to the categories, the items and the bill is saved that can be put to use at any time. The items in menu are stored in the table Itemsmaster, bills generated are stored in the Table Bill, and the customerâ€™s details in Table MemberDetails. The project uses database connectivity where details of the restaurant are stored. The front end which is the user interface is the GUI form designed in Python with the help of Tkinter module.

It provides a complete picture of a self-sufficient working restaurant kiosk that can be incorporated by many established and upcoming restaurants and reducing the long waiting lines.
